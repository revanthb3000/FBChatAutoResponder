First Condom

"I recall my first time with a condom, I was 16 or so. I went in to buy a packet of condoms at the pharmacy. There was this beautiful woman assistant behind the counter, and she could see that I was new at it. She handed me the package and asked if I knew how to wear one. I honestly answered, 	'No, this is my first time.'

So she unwrapped the package, took one out and slipped it over her thumb. She cautioned me to make sure it was on tight and secure. I apparently still looked confused. So, she looked all around the store to see if it was empty. It was empty.

'Just a minute,' she said, and walked to the door, and locked it. Taking my hand, she led me into the back room, unbuttoned her blouse and removed it. She unhooked her bra and laid it aside. 'Do these excite you'' She asked.

Well, I was so dumb-struck that all I could do was nod my head. She then said it was time to slip the condom on. As I was slipping it on, she dropped her skirt, removed her panties and lay down on a desk.

'Well, come on', she said, 'We don't have much time.' So I climbed on her. It was so wonderful, that unfortunately, I could no longer hold back and KAPOWWWWWWWW, I was done within a few moments.

She looked at me with a bit of a frown. 'Did you put that condom on'' she asked.

I said, 'I sure did,' and held up my thumb to show her.

She fainted."

Two men were shipwrecked on an island. They decided to venture inland to see if they could find someone. The men came across a village in the middle of a jungle, immediately they were surrounded by a tribe of islanders.
The chief walks to the men and says, " What do you choose, Death or Boogaloo'" The first man thinks for a second and replies, "I choose Boogaloo".
The chief smiles and the tribe begins to chant "boogaloo, boogaloo, boogaloo". The chief takes the man, bends him over and f**ks him up the ***.
The second man is horrified at what he has just witnessed and then the chief walks up to him and asks, "You must choose, Death or Boogaloo"'
The man thinks he would rather die than have boogaloo, so he replies, "I choose death".
The tribe roars in ecstasy and the chief yells, "Death by boogaloo!!!"

"I'd like to bring all my high school buddies to the party," said George, "but I don't want to get arrested."
His daughter laughed. "Why would you get arrested for bringing your high school buddies to your birthday party'"
"Don't you know'" asked George. "Grave robbing is a crime."

It's my wife's birthday tomorrow. Last week I asked her what she wanted as a present.
'Oh, I don't know,' she said . 'Just give me something with diamonds.'
That's why I'm giving her a pack of playing cards.
-------
A man asked his wife, "What would you most like for your birthday'"
She said, "I'd love to be ten again."
On the morning of her birthday, he got her up bright and early and they went to a theme park. He put her on every ride in the park - the Death Slide, The Screaming Loop, the Wall of Fear.
She had a go on every ride there was. She staggered out of the theme park five hours later, her head reeling and her stomach turning.
Then they were off to a movie theater where they ate popcorn and sweets and drank Cola. At last she staggered home with her husband and collapsed into bed.
Her husband leaned over and asked, "Well, dear, what was it like being ten again'" One eye opened and she groaned, "Actually, honey, I meant dress size!"

A lady was throwing a party for her granddaughter and had gone all out..... a caterer, band, and a hired clown. Just before the party started, two bums showed up looking for a handout. Feeling sorry for the bums, the woman told them that she would give them a meal if they will help chop some wood for her out back. Gratefully, they headed to the rear of the house.
The guests arrived and all was going well with the children having a wonderful time. But the clown hadn't shown up. After a half and hour, the clown finally called to report that he was stuck in traffic and would probably not make the party at all.
The woman was very disappointed and unsuccessfully tried to entertain the children herself. She happened to look out the window and saw one of the bums doing cartwheels across the lawn. She watched in awe as he swung from tree branches, did mid-air flips, and leaped high in the air.
She spoke to the other bum and said, "What your friend is doing is absolutely marvelous. I have never seen such a thing. Do you think your friend would consider repeating this performance for the children at the party' I would pay him $50!"
The other bum says, "Well, I dunno. Let me ask him." "HEY WILLIE! FOR $50, WOULD YOU CHOP OFF ANOTHER TOE'"

Jill just barely managed to pull him to safety.
Furious and confused, Johnny went to see his grandmother. 'Grandma,'' he said, 'it's my 21st birthday, so why can't I walk across the lake like my father, his father, and his father before him'''
Granny looked deeply into Johnny's troubled eyes and answered, 'Because your father, your grandfather, and your great-grandfather were born in January, when the lake is frozen, and you were born in July.
Little Johnny: Mom, do you know what I'm going to give you for your birthday' Mom: No, dear, what' Little Johnny: A nice teapot. Mom: But I've got a nice teapot. Little Johnny: No you haven't. I've just dropped it.

So the that's what Rich did.
The next day at the bar his buddy said, "Well' Did you take my suggestion'"

"Oh yes! she jumped up , thanked me, kissed me on the forehead and ran out the door, yelling "I'll be back in an hour!"

"That's stupid," said Jimmy.
"O.K., young man," said the mother, "you just lost one of your presents. Now you only have four. What do you have to say for yourself'"
"If I tell you the sentence I'm thinking of right now," said Jimmy, "I'll lose the other four."

A guy walking down the street sees a woman with perfect breasts. He says to her, "Hey miss, would you let me bite your breasts for $100 dollars'"
"Are you nuts'!" - she replies, and keeps walking away. He turns around, runs around the block and gets to the corner before she does.
"Would you let me bite your breasts for $1,000 dollars'" - he asks again.
"Listen you; I'm not that kind of woman! Got it'" So the guy runs around the next block and faces her again.
"Would you let me bite your breasts just once for $10,000 dollars'"
She thinks about it for a while and says, "Hmm, $10,000 dollars, eh' Ok, just once, but not here. Let's go to that dark alley over there."
So they go into the alley, where she takes off her blouse to reveal the most perfect breasts in the world. As soon as he sees them, he grabs them and starts caressing them, fondling them slowly, kissing them, licking them, burying his face in them, but not biting them.
The woman finally gets annoyed and asks, "Well' Are you gonna bite them or not'"
"Nah", he replies. "Costs too much..."

So the man approaches the lovely woman and says, "Excuse me. Would you be so kind as to dance with me'"
Seeing the man is totally drunk the woman says, "I'm sorry. Right now I'm concentrating on matrimony and I'd rather sit than dance."
So the man humbly returns to his friend.
"So what did she say'" asks the friend.
The drunk responded, "She said she's constipated on macaroni and would rather $hit in her pants."
