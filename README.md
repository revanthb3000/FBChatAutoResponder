GmailChatAutoResponder
==================

The perfect way to keep your contacts entertained even when you're not around. This uses an old version of python-xmpp library that seems to be working well for GMail. Facebook's been giving me troubles though. Look for that in a different repository.

Features:
---------
* A Joke Bot that utters random jokes.
* A Game Bot that lets the user play a nice little text game.
* The ability to sound off an alert on the system where the script is running.
